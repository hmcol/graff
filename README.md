# graff

basic program for computing and displaying various functions (R -> R)

## goals
- function approximation
  - polynomial interpolation (lagrange, newton, gradient descent coefficients)
  - taylor series
  - fourier expansion
- computations
  - derivatives
  - integrals
  - solve for zeros (algebraically or newtons method or something)
- display
  - basic functions R -> R 
  - implicit functions R^2 -> R (marching squares?)
  - 3d?
